# Chase Hughes Profiling Framework
## Linguistic Analysis Reference for Audio-Based Profiling

This document serves as the reference for automated profiling based on Chase Hughes' "6 Minute X-Ray" and "The Ellipsis Manual" methodologies, adapted for audio-only (no body language) profiling.

## 1. Social Needs (6 Categories)

## 3. Sensory Modality (VAK)

People process information through their dominant sensory channel, revealed by their word choices.

### **Visual (V)**
- **Characteristics**: Process information by seeing/visualizing
- **Word Patterns**:
  - "See what I mean"
  - "Look at this"
  - "Picture this"
  - "It appears that..."
  - "Show me"
  - "Clear", "bright", "colorful", "view", "perspective", "focus"
  - "I see your point"
  - "Looks like"

### **Auditory (A)**
- **Characteristics**: Process information by hearing/listening
- **Word Patterns**:
  - "Do you hear me?"
  - "Listen to this"
  - "Sounds like"
  - "That rings a bell"
  - "Tell me"
  - "Loud", "quiet", "tone", "resonate", "harmony", "click"
  - "Hear you loud and clear"
  - "That doesn't sound right"

### **Kinesthetic (K)**
- **Characteristics**: Process information through feeling/touch/movement
- **Word Patterns**:
  - "I feel you"
  - "Get a grip"
  - "Hold on"
  - "Touch base"
  - "Grasp the concept"

## 4. Underlying Values

Values emerge through what people talk about, prioritize, and emphasize.

### Value Categories to Track:
- **Security** vs **Risk**
- **Tradition** vs **Innovation**
- **Independence** vs **Community**
- **Achievement** vs **Relationships**
- **Logic** vs **Emotion**
- **Control** vs **Freedom**
- **Status** vs **Humility**

## 5. Behavioral Patterns

### Communication Style
- **Certainty vs Uncertainty**: Absolute language ("always", "never") vs hedging ("maybe", "might")
- **Question vs Statement Ratio**: Asking vs telling
- **Active vs Passive Voice**: Taking action vs being acted upon
- **Time Orientation**: Past-focused, present-focused, or future-focused

### Emotional Indicators
- **Positive vs Negative Language**: Optimistic vs pessimistic word choices
- **Emotional Intensity**: Extreme language vs measured language
- **Self-reference**: How often they talk about themselves

---

## Implementation Notes

### Scoring System
- Track word/phrase frequency for each category
- Weight by confidence (exact matches vs contextual)
- Require minimum sample size before assigning categories
- Update profiles incrementally as more data is collected

### Confidence Levels
- **High Confidence**: 50+ utterances analyzed, clear patterns
- **Medium Confidence**: 20-49 utterances, emerging patterns
- **Low Confidence**: 5-19 utterances, preliminary assessment
- **Insufficient Data**: <5 utterances

### Multi-dimensional Profiling
- People can show multiple needs (record top 2-3)
- VAK can be blended (record percentages)
- Decision styles may vary by context
- Values can evolve over time
